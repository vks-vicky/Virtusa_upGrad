This file is being made for git rebase practice.
My understanding of rebase if that it sets the foundation/base to the given branch.
When do we use it?

-------------------

We use it when the branch is probably dying(breaking changes are about to occur)
It temporarily stes the changes aside, rebase to branch and then reapplies the changes.
