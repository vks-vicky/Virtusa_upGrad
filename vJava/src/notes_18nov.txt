Map allows you to store data w.r.t. Key value pairs.

HashTable and HashMap are falling under Map interface.

Map<K,V> obj = new HashTable<K,V>();

obj.put() : used to add the records.

In JDK 8 we have predefined functional interfaces available to us as

(i) Consumer : This functional interface that only accepts one
argument, used for performing action, such as
printing and logging etc...

(ii) Predicate : This interface represents a Boolean valued function of one arg, it is commonly used for filtering operations in streams.

Predicate<Object> obj = (value) -> condition;
