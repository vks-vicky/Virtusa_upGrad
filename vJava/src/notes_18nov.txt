Map allows you to store data w.r.t. Key value pairs.

HashTable and HashMap are falling under Map interface.

Map<K,V> obj = new HashTable<K,V>();

obj.put() : used to add the records.

In JDK 8 we have predefined functional interfaces available to us as

(i) Consumer : This functional interface that only accepts one
argument, used for performing action, such as
printing and logging etc...

(ii) Predicate : This interface represents a Boolean valued function of one arg, it is commonly used for filtering operations in streams.

Predicate<Object> obj = (value) -> condition;

Function interface takes on arguments and returns a result. It's commonly used for transforming data.

Function<Integer,Integer> obj = (value) -> code;

map() : Transforms each element of stream into another object, resulting in a stream of the same size as input. It's used for one to one transformation.

flatMap() Transforms each element of stream into zero or more elements, as changing the size of the stream. It's used for one to many transformation.s and flattening nested structures.
