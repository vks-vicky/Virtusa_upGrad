1) What is Maven

Maven is build tool,  allows you to

	-> Create a proper Project Structure

	-> We have predefined templates w.r.t. Relevant projects,

	Example : for console, web, mvc, spring boot, microservices

	we have predefined templates are available, w.r.t. that
	we can get the project structure and default code


When you create a maven project it asks for

groupId : To which category it belongs

artifactId : It is the name of the project, as what is the name of
the project we need to give to that

package

version


How maven works

When you run the project, at first it scans the pom.xml file

as POM (Project Object Model) it is the heart for the maven project, which contains all

dependencies, plugins required to run the project


Once it scans it checks the dependencies in

1) Local Repository (.m2) folder which located in

c:\users\user_name folder

if the dependency information not found in local, then it hits central repo

https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml

2) Central Repository

if its not found in central it gets downloaded from internet that is of remote repository.
3) Remote Repository

Please add all dependencies in

<Dependencies> tag only

It contains various options
https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml
