Its monolythic application as we have various layers

Why we have layers, as the same application needs to run in web, instead of main() we have web pages.

First Step Create model in

com.java.employ.model package as

Gender.java
Employ.java

Second Step Create Exception class in

com.java.employ.exception package as

EmployException.java

Third Step is crucial as Data Layer we need to write code

dao must be in
com.java.employ.dao package

EmployDao.java file is an interface that which contains all the operations possible in the project, as it acts as a contract file or menu file.


The interface implementation can be done in EmployDaoImpl.java file


Fourth Step is Call the Dao object in Bal File as EmployBal.java file where we need to write the code for validations.

it is in com.java.employ.bal package

For AddEmploy and UpdateEmploy we need to call after validations are passed.

Fifth Step is make main method as

com.java.employ.main in that

create a file as EmployMain.java

Call the EmployBal.java in EmployMain.java

The process is

EmployDao to be called in EmployBal -> EmployBal to be called in EmployMain.


If web we replace EmployMain with web pages.
